Soapy-Android
==

Soapy-Android is the android app for the wall-mounted tablets out side of Soapy-enabled
bathrooms. It provides an endpoint for choosing one's default playlists, handles data
from the RFID and door sensors, and streams music to the speakers using the Spotify
android SDK.

Soapy is a project for making showers in the [Computer Science House](https://csh.rit.edu) a bit more
musical. See the project plan [here](https://goo.gl/M6v6lI).
