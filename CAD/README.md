# Soapy CAD
Contained in this directory are 3D models for printing enclosures for Soapy
components. The only models so far are the two parts for the in-shower RFID
mount.

I'm using [Autodesk Inventor 2016](http://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor).
It's free for students.

## Files

### RFID / RFID_Box / RFID_Lid
This is the box and lid for containing the
[RFID circuit](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/datasheet/RDM630-Spec..pdf)
and antenna and mounting them on the shower stall walls.

The circuit clips into the brackets on the inside of the lid, and the antenna
and the rectangular LED are taped or glued into the bottom of the box. The
internal connections should be made to a Cat5[e] cable that goes out the 6mm
hole between the box and lid.

The housing is to be mounted with the lid against the wall and the box's
bottom facing the person. The cable runs towards the ceiling.
